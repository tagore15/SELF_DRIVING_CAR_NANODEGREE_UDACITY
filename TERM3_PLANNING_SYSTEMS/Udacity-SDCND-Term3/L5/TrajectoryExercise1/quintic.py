def JMT(start, end, T):
    """
    Calculate the Jerk Minimizing Trajectory that connects the initial state
    to the final state in time T.

    INPUTS

    start - the vehicles start location given as a length three array
        corresponding to initial values of [s, s_dot, s_double_dot]

    end   - the desired end state for vehicle. Like "start" this is a
        length three array.

    T     - The duration, in seconds, over which this maneuver should occur.

    OUTPUT 
    an array of length 6, each value corresponding to a coefficent in the polynomial 
    s(t) = a_0 + a_1 * t + a_2 * t**2 + a_3 * t**3 + a_4 * t**4 + a_5 * t**5
