This is consolidated list of Udacity Self-driving car Nanodegree projects.

# TERM1 (Computer Vision and Deep Learning)
1) Project: Detect Lane Lines     
Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.  
    

2) Project: Traffic Sign Classification     
Implement and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Use validation sets, pooling, and dropout to choose a network architecture and improve performance.
    

3) Project: Behavioral Cloning   
Architect and train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. Collect your own training data and use it to clone your own driving behavior on a test track.     

    
4) Project: Advanced Lane Detection    
Detect lane lines in a variety of conditions, including changing road surfaces, curved roads, and variable lighting. Use OpenCV to implement camera calibration and transforms, as well as filters, polynomial fits, and splines.   

5) Project: Vehicle Tracking    
Track vehicles in camera images using image classifiers such as SVMs, decision trees, HOG, and DNNs. Apply filters to fuse position data.
    

# TERM2 (Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control) 
1) Project: Extended Kalman Filters in C++    
Extended Kalman filters are used by autonomous vehicle engineers to combine measurements from multiple sensors into a non-linear model.

2) Project: Pedestrian Tracking by Unscented Kalman filters    
Fuse noisy lidar and radar data together to track a pedestrian.

3) Project: Kidnapped Vehicle    
Implement a particle filter to take real-world data and localize a lost vehicle.

4) Project: PID Control    
Implement the classic closed-loop controller, proportional-integral-derivative control system.

5) Project: Lane-Keeping   
Implement a Model Predictive Controller to keep a simulated vehicle in its lane.

# TERM3 (Planning and System Integeration)
1) Project: Path Planning  

In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

2) Project: Semantic Segmentation
In this project, you'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).
   

3) Project: Capstone
