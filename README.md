This is consolidated list of Udacity Self-driving car Nanodegree projects.

# TERM1 (Computer Vision and Deep Learning)
1) Project: Detect Lane Lines     
Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.  
    

2) Project: Traffic Sign Classification     
Implement and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Use validation sets, pooling, and dropout to choose a network architecture and improve performance.
    

3) Project: Behavioral Cloning   
Architect and train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. Collect your own training data and use it to clone your own driving behavior on a test track.     

    
4) Project: Advanced Lane Detection    
Detect lane lines in a variety of conditions, including changing road surfaces, curved roads, and variable lighting. Use OpenCV to implement camera calibration and transforms, as well as filters, polynomial fits, and splines.   

5) Project: Vehicle Tracking    
Track vehicles in camera images using image classifiers such as SVMs, decision trees, HOG, and DNNs. Apply filters to fuse position data.
    

# TERM2 (Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control) 
1) Project: Extended Kalman Filters in C++    
Extended Kalman filters are used by autonomous vehicle engineers to combine measurements from multiple sensors into a non-linear model.

2) Project: Pedestrian Tracking by Unscented Kalman filters    
Fuse noisy lidar and radar data together to track a pedestrian.

3) Project: Kidnapped Vehicle    
Implement a particle filter to take real-world data and localize a lost vehicle.

4) Project: PID Control    
Implement the classic closed-loop controller, proportional-integral-derivative control system.

5) Project: Lane-Keeping   
Implement a Model Predictive Controller to keep a simulated vehicle in its lane.
